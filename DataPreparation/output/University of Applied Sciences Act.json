L. G. I No. 120/2002, shall apply by analogy to the calculation of ECTS credits. For part-time university of applied sciences programmes, the allocation of ECTS credits to the academic year may be lower. If admission to a university of applied sciences degree programme is limited according to § 4 para 4, fourth sentence, the amount of credits may be reduced by up to 60 ECTS credits.\n\t2a.\tUniversity of applied sciences bachelor’s programmes may be offered only in combination with university of applied sciences master’s programmes provided by the same university of applied sciences.\n\t3.\tWithin the framework of the university of applied sciences bachelor’s programmes, the students shall be required to attend a practical course on the job, which shall constitute a relevant part of the training.
