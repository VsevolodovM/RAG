## Legal Document Parser
Introduction
The Legal Document Parser is a Python-based tool designed to process legal documents in plain text (.txt) format. It extracts structured information such as chapters, sections, paragraphs, and references, saving the results as JSON files. This parser is particularly useful for organizing and analyzing legal texts, automating tasks like legal research, compliance checks, and document management.

- Outputs clean and ready-to-use JSON files.

## Usage
