The editorial part of the daily and weekly newspapers must consist mainly of independently written contributions. 2. daily newspapers must be published a minimum of 240 times a year, weekly newspapers a minimum of 41 times a year, and most of the copies must be predominantly available for public sale or for subscription in Austria; 3. daily and weekly newspapers must have been published regularly for six months before the time when the application for the grant of subsidies is filed and must have met the eligibility requirements for subsidies during that time; 4. daily newspapers must have a verifiable paid circulation of at least 10,000 copies nationwide or 6,000 copies in a particular province per issue and must employ a minimum of six full-time journalists; the average sales price in a year must not be significantly lower than that of similar daily newspapers; 5. weekly newspapers must have a verifiable paid circulation of at least 5,000 copies per issue and must employ a minimum of two full-time journalists; the average sales price in a year must not be significantly lower than that of similar weekly newspapers; 6. publishers of daily or weekly newspapers must not be a territorial authority nor may territorial authorities be directly or indirectly involved or hold a direct or indirect interest in such publishers; 7. daily and weekly newspapers must not be merely of local interest and must be distributed and be of significance in at least one province. (2) The requirements of para. 1 subparas. 4 and 5 shall not apply to print media published in a language of an ethnic group pursuant to Art. 8 para. 2 of the Federal Constitutional Law. (3) Publishers wishing to be granted subsidies pursuant to Part II and Part III of this Federal Act shall disclose the print medium’s circulation figures to KommAustria. (4) Publishers of daily newspapers shall, at the request of KommAustria, disclose the circulation figures pursuant to para. 3 broken down by provinces. (5) All circulation figures must be confirmed by a relevant industry organisation that compiles these metrics for its members according to criteria customary in the industry. If the applicant for subsidies is not a member of such an industry organisation, the applicant shall provide a confirmation regarding the verification of the circulation figures by a professional accountant or tax adviser with whom the applicant has no other contractual relations. Furthermore, KommAustria may request further personal data and documents from the applicant if this is required to assess eligibility for subsidies or to calculate the amount of subsidies. (6) Publishers of daily and weekly newspapers wishing to be granted subsidies pursuant to this Federal Act shall disclose their ownership and shareholding structures to KommAustria. (7) Local editions, edition variants and other printed media that are published by the same publisher under the same name or under a name deviating only by a regional designation or that are predominantly authored by the same editorial staff shall not be subsidised independently but shall be attributed to the parent newspaper. (8) Media owners shall be excluded from receiving subsidies if, in the year for which a subsidy is applied for or in the two preceding years, their media were used as a platform to 1. incite others to violently fight democracy or the rule of law, or 2. advocate violence against others as a means of politics, or 3. repeatedly incite others to generally disregard the law in relation to a certain field of law, or 4. repeatedly incite others to hatred or violence directed against a group of persons or a member of a group based on sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation. (8a) Media owners shall not be excluded from receiving subsidies pursuant to para. 8 if the incitement or advocacy was expressed neither by a decision-maker nor by an employee of the applicant for subsidies and if none of the decision-makers or employees of the undertaking can otherwise be accused of not having applied proper journalistic care in respect of the incriminated content contributed by third parties. (8b) If an offence punishable by a court pursuant to § 282a of the Criminal Code, Federal Law Gazette No 60/1974, or § 283 of the Criminal Code or pursuant to the provisions of the National Socialism Prohibition Act, State Law Gazette No 13/1945, is committed in the medium of a media owner, eligibility for subsidies of the medium concerned shall be forfeited in the calendar year following the date of the final conviction, provided that a final conviction was handed down for this offence. This shall not apply if the final conviction in relation to the content of the medium was handed down against a person who is neither a decision-maker nor an employee of the media owner and if none of the decision-makers or employees of the undertaking can be accused of not having applied proper journalistic care in respect of the incriminated content.

These special subsidies consist of financial support granted by the Federal Government to daily newspapers, including local editions, that are of special significance for political opinion and policy formation but do not have a market-leading position pursuant to para. 4. (2) Subsidies pursuant to this Part are granted to daily newspapers whose average paid circulation per issue does not exceed 100,000 copies in a year across the entire federal territory, whose annual number of pages consists of no more than 50% advertisements and which employ at least 12 full-time journalists. (3) The market-leading daily newspaper at the national level in terms of the number of copies sold is not eligible for special subsidies. Furthermore, the market-leading daily newspapers at the regional level are also not eligible. Should the market-leading daily newspaper at the national level also hold the leading position in a regional market, the daily newspaper with the second-largest number of copies sold in the relevant province is considered a regional market leader and is also not eligible for special subsidies. (4) The national market leader as referred to in para. 3 is the daily newspaper with the largest number of copies sold among the daily newspapers in the federal territory. The regional market leader as referred to in para. 3 is the daily newspaper with the largest number of copies sold among the daily newspapers in their relevant main regional area of circulation. The main regional area of circulation of a daily newspaper is the province in which it sells the largest number of copies. Market leadership in accordance with this provision shall be determined on the basis of total paid circulation. (5) The funds for special subsidies shall be distributed as follows: 1. Every newspaper eligible for subsidies shall receive a basic amount of EUR 500,000. 2. The remaining subsidies shall be distributed by multiplying the number of copies sold in the main regional area of circulation, up to a maximum of 25,000 copies, by the number of issues published in a year.

        "Summary": ". (1) The Federal Government contributes to preserving the diversity of daily newspapers in the provinces by means of special subsidies. These special subsidies consist of financial support granted by the Federal Government to daily newspapers, including local editions, that are of special significance for political opinion and policy formation but do not have a market-leading position pursuant to para. 4. (2) Subsidies pursuant to this Part are granted to daily newspapers whose average paid circulation per issue does not exceed 100,000 copies in a year across the entire federal territory, whose annual number of pages consists of no more than 50% advertisements and which employ at least 12 full-time journalists. (3) The market-leading daily newspaper at the national level in terms of the number of copies sold is not eligible for special subsidies. Furthermore, the market-leading daily newspapers at the regional level are also not eligible. Should the market-leading daily newspaper at the national level also hold the leading position in a regional market, the daily newspaper with the second-largest number of copies sold in the relevant province is considered a regional market leader and is also not eligible for special subsidies. (4) The national market leader as referred to in para. 3 is the daily newspaper with the largest number of copies sold among the daily newspapers in the federal territory. The regional market leader as referred to in para. 3 is the daily newspaper with the largest number of copies sold among the daily newspapers in their relevant main regional area of circulation. The main regional area of circulation of a daily newspaper is the province in which it sells the largest number of copies. Market leadership in accordance with this provision shall be determined on the basis of total paid circulation. (5) The funds for special subsidies shall be distributed as follows: 1. Every newspaper eligible for subsidies shall receive a basic amount of EUR 500,000. 2. The remaining subsidies shall be distributed by multiplying the number of copies sold in the main regional area of circulation, up to a maximum of 25,000 copies, by the number of issues published in a year. The result of this calculation shall be converted using a distribution key in such a way that the funds can be fully used. Part IV Final provisions Observation period and payment"

(2) Moreover, execution of a European arrest warrant is inadmissible for acts that are subject to the scope of application of Austrian criminal laws if 1. criminal proceedings are pending against the requested person for the same act or are initiated by the time of the court decision on the execution of the European arrest warrant, or 2. the public prosecutor decided to withdraw a report to the police or to discontinue proceedings for the same act, or to release the sought person from prosecution in some other way. (3) § 6 and para. 2 do not prevent the execution of a European arrest warrant against a person who is not an Austrian national if 1. preference is to be given to conducting the criminal proceedings in the issuing State, taking account of the special circumstances of the case, especially for reasons of ascertaining the truth and a fair trial, the protection of the justified interests of the persons injured by the act, the determination of the sentence or its enforcement, or 2. the proceedings were ended for lack of evidence, or in the absence of an application, or in the absence of an authorization of the injured person, or 3. the application of Austrian criminal law is solely based on § 65 StGB.

(1) After the head of the detention facility presents the documents listed in § 42a, the Federal Ministry of Justice has to examine whether the prerequisites according to § 42 prevail or presumably will prevail. Where appropriate, the Federal Ministry of Justice shall request the competent authority of the executing State to enforce the custodial sentence or the preventive measure involving deprivation of liberty imposed. (2) The Federal Ministry of Justice shall consult the competent authority of the executing State prior to forwarding the documents listed in para. 4 by any appropriate means in order to obtain the consent necessary under § 42 para. 1 item 3. It shall set forth due to which reasons the enforcement of the custodial sentence or the preventive measure involving deprivation of liberty imposed in the executing State serves the purpose of facilitating the social rehabilitation and reintegration of the sentenced person into society. (3) The Federal Ministry of Justice may, on a case-by-case basis, decide not to request the enforcement of the custodial sentence or the preventive measure involving deprivation of liberty imposed in the executing State if due to specific circumstances the sentenced person has such close bonds to Austria that it can be assumed that the enforcement of the custodial sentence or the preventive measure involving deprivation of liberty imposed in Austria serves the purpose of facilitating the social rehabilitation and reintegration of the sentenced person into society. (4) The Federal Ministry of Justice shall forward the following documents to the competent authority of the executing State: 1. the judgment together with its translation, if such translation has already been made for the sentenced foreigner in the national proceedings; 2. a certificate (Annex VII) completed and signed with the request to forward the applicable provisions of the executing State on release on probation or early release and, unless the executing State has declared to accept certificates also in the German language, their translation in one of the official languages of the executing State or any other language accepted by this State; 3. the protocol of the declaration of the sentenced person under § 42a; and 4. if the sentenced person is already in the executing State, the completed standard form for the notification of the sentenced person (Annex VIII). (5) If the competent authority of the executing State does not consider the certificate enough to decide on the enforcement, on its request a translation of the judgment or the relevant parts of such in to the official language or one of the official languages of the executing State or in any other official language of the institutions of the European Union accepted by the executing State shall be forwarded to such authority. Where appropriate, the relevant parts of the judgment to be translated shall be identified in the framework of consultations by the competent authority of the executing State. The translation of the judgment or the relevant parts of it may only be requested if the executing State has made the corresponding declaration. (6) A request of the competent authority of the executing State or the sentenced person to forward the documents listed in para. 4 does not constitute an obligation to forward them. (7) If the competent authority of the executing State after the forwarding of the documents listed in para. 4 forwards a reasoned opinion that the enforcement or the custodial sentence of the preventive measure involving deprivation of liberty imposed does not serve the purpose of facilitating the social rehabilitation and reintegration of the sentenced person into society in the executing State under the terms of § 42 para. 1 items 1 and 2, the Federal Ministry of Justice has to examine whether the certificate (Annex VII) shall be withdrawn. The competent authority of the executing State shall be informed of the result of such examination stating the reasons for the decision. (7a) If the custodial sentence or the preventive measure involving deprivation of liberty has been imposed because of more than one criminal act and if the competent authority of the executing State forwards the information that enforcement cannot be taken over with regard to an individual act, the court that has taken the decision in first instance has to decide with a resolution on request of the office of pubic prosecution which part of the custodial sentence or the preventive measure involving deprivation of liberty corresponds to this criminal act regarding which enforcement has been taken over. If a custodial sentence or preventive measure involving deprivation of liberty of at least five years has been imposed, the decision is taken by the Landesgericht (Regional Court) as a senate of three judges (§ 31 para. 6 StPO). Against this resolution the office of public prosecution and the sentenced person have the right to appeal to the Oberlandesgericht (Higher Regional Court) within 14 days. After the decision is final and binding the Federal Ministry of Justice has to forward it to the competent authority of the executing State. (8) § 14 para. 1 to 5 shall be applied to the means of communication. If the judgment and the certificate have not been forwarded by mail, a copy or certified copy of the judgment and the original certificate shall be forwarded by mail on request of the competent authority of the executing State. (9) It is not admitted to request more than one Member State at a time to enforce a sentence. (10) The sentenced person staying in Austria shall be informed of the decision to request enforcement in the executing State in a language understood by him or her using the completed standard form in Annex VIII.

(1) If investigation measures are ordered in criminal proceedings which have to be executed in another Member State except for Denmark or Ireland, if evidence must be taken, if the transmission of investigation results or if the transfer of a person in custody must be obtained, a European Investigation Order can be issued. In such case it has to be taken into consideration whether the involvement of another Member State is proportionate in relation to the seriousness of the criminal act, the severity of guilt, the consequences of the criminal act, the degree of suspicion and the desired result. § 55 para. 2 shall apply mutatis mutandis. (2) In investigation proceedings, a European Investigation Order shall be issued by the public prosecution office and shall require no court approval. In the case of the court taking evidence (§ 104 StPO) or after an indictment has been raised, the European Investigation Order shall be issued by the competent court. (3) The executing authority shall be provided with a completed and signed certificate (Annex XVII) and, unless the executing State has agreed to also accept certificates in the German language, with a translation of such certificate into the official language of the executing State or into another language accepted by such State. The Federal Minister for Constitutional Affairs, Reforms, Deregulation and Justice shall announce by a decree which Member States accept which official languages. (4) If the European Investigation Order has been issued for the purpose of transferring a person in Austrian custody, the judge sitting singly at the court designated in § 16 Correction Service Act, otherwise the court which had ordered the custody, shall conclude a written agreement pursuant to § 55g para. 3 with the executing authority. In the case of a transfer of a person in custody in another Member State, such agreement shall be concluded by the public prosecution office. To the European Investigation Order for transferring a person in Austrian custody shall be enclosed the consent declaration of such person and if necessary, the statement of his/her legal representative. After releasing such person from custody upon request of the authority of the executing State, a detention or a measure involving deprivation of liberty in Austria for the action mentioned in the European Investigation Order may only be justified by the circumstances mentioned in § 55g, para. 6, items 1 and 2, or with the consent of the person transferred. § 36 and § 55g para. 4 to 8 shall apply mutatis mutandis. (5) Issuing a European Investigation Order for the purpose of interrogating a suspected or accused person by telephone conference is not permitted. (6) If the surveillance of communication of a person residing in the executing State can be performed without technical assistance pursuant to § 138, para. 3 StPO, the executing authority shall be provided with a completed and signed notification (Annex XIX) and, unless the executing State has agreed to also accept notifications in the German language, with a translation of such notification into the official language of the executing State or into another language accepted by such State, namely 1. prior to performing the surveillance, if it is known that the targeted person is staying in the executing State or will travel there during the surveillance; 2. during or after a surveillance, if it becomes known after the date mentioned in item 1 that the targeted person is staying in the executing State. (7) § 14 shall be applied mutatis mutandis to business communications. If the European Investigation Order has not been received by mail, the original order shall be provided to the executing authority by mail upon their request at a later stage. Information",

        "Summary": ". (1) If investigation measures are ordered in criminal proceedings which have to be executed in another Member State except for Denmark or Ireland, if evidence must be taken, if the transmission of investigation results or if the transfer of a person in custody must be obtained, a European Investigation Order can be issued. In such case it has to be taken into consideration whether the involvement of another Member State is proportionate in relation to the seriousness of the criminal act, the severity of guilt, the consequences of the criminal act, the degree of suspicion and the desired result. § 55 para. 2 shall apply mutatis mutandis. (2) In investigation proceedings, a European Investigation Order shall be issued by the public prosecution office and shall require no court approval. In the case of the court taking evidence (§ 104 StPO) or after an indictment has been raised, the European Investigation Order shall be issued by the competent court. (3) The executing authority shall be provided with a completed and signed certificate (Annex XVII) and, unless the executing State has agreed to also accept certificates in the German language, with a translation of such certificate into the official language of the executing State or into another language accepted by such State. The Federal Minister for Constitutional Affairs, Reforms, Deregulation and Justice shall announce by a decree which Member States accept which official languages. (4) If the European Investigation Order has been issued for the purpose of transferring a person in Austrian custody, the judge sitting singly at the court designated in § 16 Correction Service Act, otherwise the court which had ordered the custody, shall conclude a written agreement pursuant to § 55g para. 3 with the executing authority. In the case of a transfer of a person in custody in another Member State, such agreement shall be concluded by the public prosecution office. To the European Investigation Order for transferring a person in Austrian custody shall be enclosed the consent declaration of such person and if necessary, the statement of his/her legal representative. After releasing such person from custody upon request of the authority of the executing State, a detention or a measure involving deprivation of liberty in Austria for the action mentioned in the European Investigation Order may only be justified by the circumstances mentioned in § 55g, para. 6, items 1 and 2, or with the consent of the person transferred. § 36 and § 55g para. 4 to 8 shall apply mutatis mutandis. (5) Issuing a European Investigation Order for the purpose of interrogating a suspected or accused person by telephone conference is not permitted. (6) If the surveillance of communication of a person residing in the executing State can be performed without technical assistance pursuant to § 138, para. 3 StPO, the executing authority shall be provided with a completed and signed notification (Annex XIX) and, unless the executing State has agreed to also accept notifications in the German language, with a translation of such notification into the official language of the executing State or into another language accepted by such State, namely 1. prior to performing the surveillance, if it is known that the targeted person is staying in the executing State or will travel there during the surveillance; 2. during or after a surveillance, if it becomes known after the date mentioned in item 1 that the targeted person is staying in the executing State. (7) § 14 shall be applied mutatis mutandis to business communications. If the European Investigation Order has not been received by mail, the original order shall be provided to the executing authority by mail upon their request at a later stage. Information"

The assignment of the issuing State is binding subject to § 103 para. 2 item 3; 5. if the punishability of the act falling under the scope of the Austrian criminal laws is time barred according to Austrian law; 6. as far as monitoring the supervision measures would violate provisions on immunity; 7. if the person concerned at the time of the criminal act related to which the decision on the application of supervision measures has been taken, had not yet reached the age of criminal responsibility; 8. if in the case of a breach of the supervision measure imposed on part of the person concerned the execution of a European arrest warrant would have to be refused; 9. if there are objective indications that the decision on the application of supervision measures has been taken in violation of fundamental rights or basic principles within the meaning of Art. 6 of the Treaty on the European Union, especially if the decision has been taken for the purpose of punishing the sentenced person due to reasons of sex, race, religion, ethnic origin, nationality, language, political conviction or sexual orientation and if the person concerned did not have the possibility to state this circumstance before the European Court of Human Rights or the Court of the European Union. (2) If the person concerned does not live or permanently reside in Austria, responsibility for monitoring supervision measures can still be assumed on request of the competent authority of the issuing State on application of the person concerned if due to determined circumstances the person concerned has ties to Austria of such intensity that it can be assumed that monitoring supervision measures in Austria would serve the facilitation of resocialisation and reintegration of the person concerned into society. (3) In the cases of para. 1 item 8 responsibility for monitoring supervision measures can still be assumed after having obtained the consent of the competent authority of the issuing State explicitly indicating that in case of a breach of the supervision measures imposed on part of the person concerned the execution of a European arrest warrant would have to be refused. (4) In relation to taxes or duties, customs and exchange, assuming supervision may not be refused on the grounds that Austrian law does not impose the same kind of tax or duty or does not contain the same type of rules as regards taxes or duties, customs and exchange regulations as the law of the issuing State.

(3) Degree programmes mean university of applied sciences bachelor's and university of applied sciences master's programmes. Continuing education programmes mean continuing higher education programmes under § 9 and the attendance of individual courses. (4) The educational requirement for admission to a university of applied sciences Bachelor’s programme shall be the general university entrance qualification or a subject-relevant professional qualification; the educational requirement for admission to a university of applied sciences Master’s programme shall be the completion of a subject-relevant university of applied sciences Bachelor’s programme or the completion of an equivalent degree programme at a recognised domestic or foreign post-secondary educational institution. This shall be an educational institution offering degree programmes lasting for at least six semesters which requires the general university entrance qualification under this Act for admission and which is recognised as a post-secondary educational institution according to the legal regulations of the country in which it is domiciled. In case that equivalence has been established basically and only certain supplementary qualifications are required for full equivalence, the programme director shall be entitled to tie the determination of equivalence to examinations to be taken during the Master’s programme. If the scientific and didactic concept of a university of applied sciences degree programme is based on professional experience, admission to such a university of applied sciences degree programme may be limited to an appropriate target group. If a degree programme requires proficiency in a particular language, students shall submit proof of proficiency in this language. (5) The general university entrance qualification shall be proved by one of the following documents: 1. Austrian secondary-school leaving certificate, including a certificate of the TVE Diploma Examination, 2. any other Austrian certificate testifying the right to study a certain group of studies at a university, a university college of teacher education, or a university of applied sciences, 3. a foreign certificate which, in the individual case, is equivalent to one of these Austrian certificates on the basis of an agreement under international law or a nostrification or a decision taken by the programme director of the Austrian university of applied sciences degree programme, 4. a document certifying the completion of studies of at least three years (and 180 ECTS credits) at an recognised domestic or foreign post-secondary educational institution. (5a) In case of doubts on the authenticity of the documents which should serve as evidence for the access requirements, or the correctness as regards content, or in case that they are not sufficient for a decision, the provider of the university of applied sciences may review the documents or the knowledge of the applicant by itself or by specialists to be charged by the university of applied sciences. For that purpose, the provider of the university of applied sciences may levy a surety of up to EUR 500 which shall be reimbursed to the applicant if the review has proved the authenticity and the correctness of the documents and he/she fulfils the access requirements. (6) In case the foreign certificates are not equivalent as to contents and requirements of an Austrian secondary-school leaving examination, the programme director shall prescribe supplementary examinations that are necessary to establish an equivalence with the domestic secondary-school leaving examination and which shall be passed prior to admission. (7) If required by the educational objectives of the respective degree programme, first-year students with a relevant professional qualification shall submit proof of the completion of additional examinations. The definitions of the relevant professional qualifications and additional examinations shall be laid down for the respective degree programme as part of the accreditation upon application by the provider or, in individual cases, by the programme director for qualifications not regulated by the official accreditation notification.
