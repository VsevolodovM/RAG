University of applied sciences degree programmes may also be run as joint degree programmes or as jointly offered study programmes. “Joint programmes” mean study programmes which are offered and completed jointly on the basis of agreements between two or several universities, university colleges of teacher education, universities of applied sciences, private university colleges, private universities or foreign recognised post-secondary educational institutions. Following the completion of a joint programme, a joint degree may be awarded. In that case, a joint awarding document shall be issued attesting to the award of the joint academic degrees. Following the completion of a joint programme, a double degree may be awarded. In that case, two awarding documents shall be issued attesting to the award of the respective academic degrees.

The quality of teaching shall be assured by scientifically, scientifically-artistically, artistically or professionally and didactically appropriately qualified teaching staff. (2) Continuing higher education programmes may also be run as continuing education bachelor's programmes and continuing education master's programmes. The workload associated with continuing education bachelor's programmes shall amount to 180 ECTS credits, and that associated with continuing education master's programmes to 120 ECTS credits. In exceptional cases, the workload for a continuing education master's programme may amount to less ECTS credits, if this is comparable to the scope and requirements of several related foreign master's programmes. (3) Continuing higher education programmes may be run as joint programmes or as jointly offered study programmes. (4) Continuing higher education programmes may be offered and conducted in co-operation with legal entities outside the higher education area for the purpose of financial and organisational support. As an exception to this rule, extended cooperation with educational institutions outside higher education is required for continuing higher education programmes upon completion of which the academic degree “Bachelor Professional” or “Master Professional” shall be awarded.

These agreements shall be published without any personal references on the websites of the institutions concerned, excluding the disclosure of private funding sources as well as of operational and business secrets. (5) Continuing education students attending continuing higher education programmes shall pay programme fees which shall be set with regard to the actual costs of the continuing higher education programme. (6) Admission 1. to a continuing higher education programme leading to a bachelor's degree requires the general university entrance qualification and several years of professional experience in a relevant field. 2. to a continuing higher education programme upon completion of which the academic degree “Bachelor Professional“ shall be awarded, requires a subject-relevant professional qualification or several years of professional experience in a relevant field. If required by the curriculum, supplementary examinations may be prescribed. The board shall be entitled to determine which of these supplementary examinations are prerequisites for sitting examinations that are prescribed in the curriculum of the continuing higher education programme. (7) Admission to a continuing higher education programme leading to a master's degree requires the successful completion of a relevant university of applied sciences bachelor's programme amounting to a minimum of 180 ECTS credits, of another related study programme of at least the same academic level at a recognised domestic or foreign post-secondary educational institution or a study programme as defined in the curriculum of the continuing higher education programme and several years of professional experience in a relevant field. To compensate for significant differences, it may be specified that supplementary examinations have to be taken. The board shall be entitled to determine which of these supplementary examinations are prerequisites for sitting examinations that are prescribed in the curriculum of the continuing higher education programme. In derogation thereof, the curriculum for continuing higher education programmes upon completion of which the academic degree “Executive Master of Business Administration” is awarded, may prescribe a relevant professional qualification as admission requirement, provided that the admission requirements, scope and requirements are demonstrably comparable to those of several related foreign master's programmes.
