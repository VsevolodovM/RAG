(1) The application for issuing security clearance certificates has to be submitted to the Federal Minister who is responsible for the respective industrial activity or research activity or for the particular contract according to the Federal Ministries Law 1986, FLG no. 76. (2) Before deciding on the issue of a security clearance certificate the Federal Minister for Home Affairs must be consulted. They take the decision together, whether an institution can ensure the protection for classified information of the classification level described in the application as per the Information Security Ordinance (§ 6). (3) While working on the decision as per para. 2, all persons who require access to information, which was classified as \"CONFIDENTIAL\", \"SECRET\" or \"TOP SECRET\", for the fulfilment of their professional duties should also undergo a security check as per §§ 55 to 55b of the Security Police Act, FLG no. 566/1991. The result should be communicated to the concerned Federal Minister (para. 1). (4) The prerequisites for issuing a security clearance certificate exist, if the applicant satisfies the constraints and conditions required by the respective obligation under international law. The concerned Federal Minister has to regularly verify the compliance with these constraints and conditions by security inspections. In this the Federal Minister for Home Affairs should be consulted. The security clearance certificate has to be revoked, if 1. the prerequisites for issuing it do not exist anymore or 2. the company or institution wrongly refuses the security inspection officials access during the usual business or working hours to their properties, business and operating rooms to the extent necessary for the inspection or does not provide the required cooperation during the inspection. (4a) The issue and revocation of the security clearance certificate are carried out, on recommendation of the responsible Federal Minister (para. 1), by the national certification authority specified by the respective agreement under international law. This is the Information Security Commission at the Federal Chancellery (§ 8), provided nothing else is expressly mentioned. For the issue of the security clearance certificates in connection with activities, which serve the fulfilment of tasks of the armed services as per Art. 79 para. 1 Federal Constitutional Law, the national certification authority is an office within that department, declared by the Federal Minister for National Defence to be responsible for this activity. The security clearance certificate is to be sent by the certification authority to the institution, the classified information of which the applicant wants to have access to; this also applies to the revocation. The applicant has to be informed about the issue or the revocation. (4b) When persons abroad are to be given access to classified information or access to places having an increased security level, in the framework of the international visit control procedure, the personal data concerning them may be transmitted with their consent to the institution, which is responsible for the security of the access to the information or places in question. § 25 MBG remains untouched. (5) If a security clearance certificate cannot be issued, the responsible Federal Minister (para. 1) has to inform the applicant of it in writing immediately after receiving knowledge of this circumstance. (6) If the application has to be made to the Federal Minister for National Defence as per para. l, then the latter has to confirm, whether an institution can ensure the classification level described in the application for the protection of classified information provided by the Information Security Ordinance (§ 6). Para. 3 has to be applied with the stipulation, that in lieu of the security check a reliability test has to be carried out as per §§ 23 and 24 Armed Forces Authority Act, FLG 1 no. 86/2000. The Federal Minister for National Defence is authorised to entrust by ordinance a subordinate office of the Federal Ministry of national defence with the execution of these tasks in his place.
