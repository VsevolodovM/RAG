# RAG-Based-Austrian-Legal-Agent


## Abstract
Legal texts are often complex and challenging to interpret or navigate, particularly for individuals without a legal background. Finding the appropriate law for a specific situation without expert assistance can be time-consuming and inefficient. This project utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combined with large language models (LLMs) to create a tool designed to facilitate legal search, summarization, and explanation generation, with a focus on Austrian legislation.

## Description 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the capabilities of the RAG architecture, enhanced with advanced techniques, for performing high-quality search, generation, and summarization of legal data. It aims to streamline the analysis and understanding of Austrian legal texts by providing accurate and context-aware results.


## Data 
The data for this project is sourced from the [RIS (Rechtsinformationssystem des Bundes)][1] website. A sample dataset, along with a processing script, is available in the projectiq directory for demonstration and testing purposes.
